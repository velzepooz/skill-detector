## Running the Tool

```bash
# Scan a skill package directory
./bin/skill-detector scan <path-to-skill-directory>

# Example: scan the malicious test fixture
./bin/skill-detector scan ./testdata/malicious/credential-theft

# Example: scan a clean skill
./bin/skill-detector scan ./testdata/clean/simple-skill

# Print version, rule count and the registry checksum
./bin/skill-detector version

# Diff two scan results (grade movement + finding diff)
./bin/skill-detector scan ./base --format json > base.json
./bin/skill-detector scan ./head --format json > head.json
./bin/skill-detector delta base.json head.json --format markdown
```

## Formatting

Go source is formatted with standard `gofmt` tab indentation.

```bash
make fmt
```

## Project Structure

```
cmd/skill-detector/    → CLI entry point (Cobra): scan + delta sub-commands
pkg/axes/              → Axis + Grade enums (wire-stable)
pkg/grade/             → Per-axis worst-finding-wins aggregator
pkg/config/            → Configuration loading
pkg/model/             → Shared domain types (Finding, ScanResult, FileContext, AxisResult)
pkg/scanner/           → File discovery (incl. .gitignore) + scan orchestration
pkg/rules/             → Security rules + file-class predicates (path gates)
pkg/triage/            → Pluggable Verifier seam (no-op unless a Verifier is injected)
pkg/delta/             → Scan-to-scan grade movement + finding diff
pkg/permission/        → Skill manifest permission extraction
pkg/scorer/            → Legacy flat-score (backward compat)
pkg/reporter/          → Output formatting (text with Trust Score block, JSON, quiet)
testdata/              → Test fixtures (clean, malicious, cve, bench, edge-cases)
```

Public packages live under `pkg/` because downstream consumers (e.g. `skilltrust`) import the scanner, rules, and grade aggregator as a library.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run tests for a specific package
go test -v ./pkg/rules/...

# Run a specific test
go test -v -run TestScanner_CleanScan ./pkg/scanner/

# Run CVE reproducer tests (Go-API + binary E2E)
go test -v -run TestCVE ./cmd/skill-detector/

# Run the curated-slice test (every case in testdata/bench must stay flagged)
go test -v -run TestBench ./cmd/skill-detector/
```

### Test Fixture Structure

- **`testdata/clean/`** — Skills that should pass with zero findings
- **`testdata/malicious/`** — Agent-file-shaped fixtures that should trigger specific rules
  - Paths must satisfy `InScope(ctx)` (e.g. `SKILL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/scripts/<orig>.sh`, or any file sitting beside a `SKILL.md`/`skill.yaml` — a skill root) so path-gated rules can fire
  - One subdir per rule or attack shape; `ls testdata/malicious/` lists the current set
- **`testdata/cve/`** — Minimal CVE reproducer repos used by `cmd/skill-detector/cve_repro_test.go` for both Go-API and binary E2E paths
- **`testdata/bench/`** — Curated malicious slice exercised by a bench test in `cmd/skill-detector`; every case must stay flagged
- **`testdata/edge-cases/`** — Boundary conditions
  - `empty-skill/`, `malformed-yaml/`, `hidden-dir/`, `binary-file/`

### Adversarial Fixtures

`cmd/skill-detector/testdata/adversarial/` is a second gate, and it is not a smaller copy of
the fixture sets above. A corpus of real-world skills measures what a suppression **costs** —
how many honest skills it stops over-flagging. Only a constructed case measures what a
suppression lets through. The two are complementary and neither substitutes for the other.

The reason is structural, not a matter of corpus size: skill-detector is public, an attacker
reads the rules, and a corpus of skills written before a rule existed cannot contain an
evasion of that rule. A corpus run can therefore be entirely unmoved by a change that a
constructed case reacts to immediately.

**The rule: every suppression, demotion or exemption ships with a fixture that tries to abuse
it.** Not a unit test of the regex — a whole skill package, scanned end-to-end, asserting a
**grade on a named axis**. Grade-level because what regresses is the grade a user sees: a
rule-level assertion passes happily while the finding is demoted onto an axis nobody gates on.
Axis-named because a finding that moves from `security` to `transparency` has, for a consumer
gating on `--fail-on-axis security=B`, disappeared.

Every attack fixture needs a benign twin — the measured shape the suppression exists for — or
the suite ratchets towards flagging everything.

Both halves have to be watched failing. An attack fixture proves nothing until you have broken
the suppression and seen it fail; a control proves nothing until you have deleted the
suppression and seen it fail too. A control that would pass with the suppression gone is not
measuring the suppression — it is measuring nothing.

Three tables in `cmd/skill-detector/adversarial_test.go`:

| Table | Asserts | Add a case when |
|---|---|---|
| `adversarialCases` | a grade on a named axis: `atLeast` (this grade or worse) for attacks, `atMost` (this grade or better) for controls | you add or narrow a suppression, or add its benign twin |
| `uncoveredShapes` | zero findings | no rule matches a shape at all — the case announces itself the day one starts to |
| `knownGapCases` | the grade the engine produces **today** | a rule matches the shape but a suppression drops or demotes it, and the current behaviour is being recorded rather than changed |

Run them with:

```bash
go test ./cmd/skill-detector -run TestAdversarial
```

**A `knownGapCases` assertion pins behaviour we do not consider final. Never relax one to
make it pass.** These cases exist so that a change in that behaviour is loud instead of
silent. If one fails, the engine has changed and the case must be **moved** into
`adversarialCases` with the grade it now earns — never edited in place to accept the new
grade, and never deleted. The same applies to `uncoveredShapes`. Each case carries a `why`
naming the mechanism it holds and what would move it.

## Linting

The project uses golangci-lint v2 with the `standard` preset plus `gosec` for security checks:

```bash
make lint
```

Configuration is in `.golangci.yml`:
- Preset: `standard` (default linters)
- Additional: `gosec` (Go security linter)
- Exclusions: comments, standard error handling, common false positives
- gosec `G101` (hardcoded credentials) is excluded in test files

## Adding a New Security Rule

1. Create a new file in `pkg/rules/` (e.g., `new_threat.go`)
2. Implement the Rule interface defined in `pkg/rules/rule.go`. Embed `baseRule` and set the `axis` field at registration so `baseRule.newFinding` can stamp `Finding.Axis` automatically.
3. **Add a path gate as the FIRST statement of `Match()`** — typically `if !InScope(ctx) { return nil }`. `InScope` is `IsAgentFile(path) || isInAgentConfigDir(path) || InSkillSubtree(ctx)`: an agent file by name, any file inside `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.opencode/` and friends, or any file inside a directory containing a skill manifest (`SKILL.md` or `skill.yaml`). Use a narrower composition only when a rule must deliberately not fire on one of those classes. Without a gate, the rule will fire on every file with a matching extension and balloon the noise floor on real-world repos.
4. Register the rule in `pkg/rules/registry.go::DefaultRegistry()` — the CLI builds its registry from that one function.
5. Add test fixtures in `testdata/malicious/<rule>/` at agent-file-shaped paths (e.g. `SKILL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/scripts/foo.sh`) so the path gate doesn't block them.
6. Write tests in `pkg/rules/new_threat_test.go`. Each rule needs:
   - A paired clean fixture test (must NOT trigger on benign content)
   - A `TestSDxxx_GatesNonAgentFile` test (must NOT fire on `node_modules/.../README.md` or similar non-agent paths)
7. Run `make test` and `make lint` to verify
8. Classify the rule in `pkg/permission/extractor.go`: either map it to the capabilities a finding implies (`ruleCapabilities`) or list it in `capabilityFreeRules`. `TestCapabilityTableCoversEveryRegisteredRule` fails until you do — that is deliberate, it keeps the reported `permissions` from going stale
9. The new rule's `(ID, Name, Severity, Category, Axis)` changes the registry checksum reported by `./bin/skill-detector version`. Nothing gates on the value, but note the new one in the CHANGELOG — it tells downstream consumers that grading behavior changed

## JSON Output Schema

The `--format json` wire format is versioned by `model.SchemaVersion`
(`pkg/model/model.go`). Downstream consumers (`scan-action`, the hosted scanner)
parse that output, so the version is a contract, not a label.

**Rule: change the shape, bump the version — in the same commit.** "Shape" means
any field added, renamed, removed or retyped in `ScanResult` or anything nested
inside it. Use a minor bump (`1.4` → `1.5`) for additive changes and a major one
(`2.0`) when existing fields move or disappear.

Two tests in `cmd/skill-detector/schema_golden_test.go` enforce this:

- `TestScanJSONOutputMatchesSchemaGolden` compares real `scan --format json`
  output against `cmd/skill-detector/testdata/schema_output.golden`. Checksum,
  build version and rule count are normalized out, so ordinary rule work does not
  disturb it — but any field change does.
- `TestSchemaShapeIsPinnedToVersion` hashes the set of JSON key paths and their
  types and compares it with the fingerprint recorded for the current version in
  `cmd/skill-detector/testdata/schema_shapes.json`. Re-blessing the golden without
  bumping the version fails here, because the new shape collides with the one
  already pinned to that version.

When a shape change is intentional: bump `model.SchemaVersion`, then

```bash
go test ./cmd/skill-detector -run TestScanJSONOutputMatchesSchemaGolden -args -update-schema-golden
go test ./cmd/skill-detector -run TestSchemaShapeIsPinnedToVersion   # prints the fingerprint to record
```

and add the printed `"<version>": "<fingerprint>"` entry to `schema_shapes.json`.
Keep the old entries — they are the record of which shape each released version
emitted.

## CI/CD

### CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

Runs on every push to `main` and all pull requests:

1. **Lint** — `make lint` (golangci-lint with gosec)
2. **Test** — `make test` (all Go tests)
3. **Build** — `make build` (compile binary)
4. **Self-scan** — `make self-scan` (scan test fixtures with built binary)

### Release Pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

Triggered by pushing a version tag (`v*`):

1. Runs GoReleaser to build cross-platform binaries
2. Creates a GitHub Release with artifacts
3. Updates the Homebrew tap (`velzepooz/homebrew-tap`)

## Releasing

Releases are cut via Git tags. Pushing a `v*` tag triggers the release
workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`), which runs GoReleaser to build
cross-platform binaries and update the Homebrew cask in the tap repo.

### One-time setup

Already in place — only re-do these if something breaks:

1. **Public tap repo:** `github.com/velzepooz/homebrew-tap` holds the
   `Casks/skill-detector.rb` file that Homebrew installs from.
2. **Personal Access Token:** fine-grained PAT scoped to
   `velzepooz/homebrew-tap`, permission `Contents: Read and write`. This is
   needed because the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` only has write access to the
   current repo, not to a separate tap repo.
3. **Repo secret:** `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` stored under Settings →
   Secrets and variables → Actions on `skilltrust/skill-detector`. Referenced
   in both `.goreleaser.yml` and `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

If a release fails at the Homebrew step with a `403` or "resource not
accessible by integration" error, rotate the PAT and update the secret.

### Cutting a release

Use the Makefile target:

```bash
make release VERSION=v0.2.0
```

Safety checks run before the tag is pushed:

- `VERSION` is provided and matches `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-prerelease]`
- Working tree is clean (no staged or unstaged changes)
- Currently on the `main` branch
- Local `HEAD` equals `origin/main` (in sync with the remote)
- Tag does not already exist

If any check fails, the target aborts before touching Git. On success it
creates an annotated tag and pushes it to `origin`. Watch the workflow at:

```
https://github.com/skilltrust/skill-detector/actions
```

### Versioning

The project follows [semver](https://semver.org):

- `v0.X.Y` — early-stage. Breaking changes allowed between minor versions.
- `v1.0.0` — first stable release. Breaking changes require a major bump.
- Prerelease suffixes (`v0.2.0-rc1`, `v0.2.0-beta.1`) are allowed and accepted
  by the `make release` validator.

Rough guidance for picking the bump:

| Change                          | Bump  |
| ------------------------------- | ----- |
| Bug fix, false-positive tweak   | patch |
| New rule, new CLI flag          | minor |
| Breaking rule output / exit code | major |

A new rule — or any change to a rule's severity, category or axis — also moves
the registry checksum reported by `./bin/skill-detector version`. Note the new
value in the CHANGELOG entry: it is the signal that grading behavior changed.

### Dry-running a release locally

Before tagging — especially after editing `.goreleaser.yml` — you can build
exactly what the pipeline would build without publishing anything:

```bash
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean --skip=publish
```

Inspect `dist/` to see the generated archives, checksums, and
`dist/homebrew/Casks/skill-detector.rb`. Requires `brew install goreleaser`.

### If a release fails

**Workflow fails before the GitHub Release is created** (build or lint errors):
fix the issue on `main`, then delete the bad tag locally and remotely and
re-cut:

```bash
git tag -d v0.2.0
git push --delete origin v0.2.0
# fix, commit, push, then:
make release VERSION=v0.2.0
```

**Workflow fails at the Homebrew step but the GitHub Release was created:**
binaries are already published — only the cask update failed. Fix the root
cause (usually the PAT or `.goreleaser.yml`), push the fix to `main`, then
re-run just the failed job from the Actions UI. Do not delete the GitHub
Release unless the binaries themselves are bad.

**Bad release already published and users installed it:** do *not*
force-overwrite an existing tag. Cut a new patch version with the fix. Tag
immutability keeps user installs reproducible — a user who installed
`v0.2.0` yesterday should get the same bits tomorrow.

## Configuration

The tool reads configuration from a YAML file. Configuration supports:
- Per-rule enable/disable toggles
- Allowlists for suppressing known-safe findings
- Default values are provided in `pkg/config/defaults.go`
