> CLI to spot risky AI skill packages before you install them.

Scans AI skill folders and agent-instruction files — Claude Code, Codex CLI,
OpenCode, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and similar
file-based formats — for security threats so you can vet third-party
skills — e.g. from [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) — without reading every
line by hand.

> ⚠️ **Status:** Early-stage (v0.x). Usable, but rules and flags may change before 1.0.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed in each release.

## Why

Installing a skill from a third-party source means running someone else's code
and prompts inside your AI assistant. A malicious skill can exfiltrate
credentials, inject prompts, run shell commands, or quietly tamper with files.
`skill-detector` runs security checks over a skill folder and flags anything
suspicious, so you get a second opinion before dropping it into your skills
directory.

## What it checks

Eleven rule categories (25 rules total), purpose-built for AI agent skill
packages and the surrounding configuration files:

| Category             | Catches                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Injection**        | Shell / command injection (incl. bash fences in Markdown), prompt injection |
| **Supply chain**     | Suspicious deps, unpinned installs, typosquats          |
| **Exfiltration**     | Outbound HTTP to unknown hosts, clipboard / env reads, DNS tunneling |
| **Misconfiguration** | Over-broad permissions, unsafe defaults                 |
| **Integrity**        | Tampered or unsigned files                              |
| **Access control**   | Permission-declaration vs. actual-behavior mismatches   |
| **CLAUDE.md**        | SQL-injection-by-instruction, Comment-and-Control patterns |
| **settings.json**    | `Bash(curl:*)`/`Bash(curl*)` and PowerShell wildcards, unrestricted `"*"` grant, redundant deny made moot by a broader allow, unsanctioned hooks |
| **Hooks**            | Shell metacharacter interpolation in hook command strings (real nested Claude Code schema) |
| **MCP**              | External-domain reach (raise to High with `--strict-mcp`) and auto-installed registry packages (`npx`/`uvx`/`pipx`/`bunx`) |
| **Reverse shell**    | Reverse-shell payloads in skill scripts and instruction files |

Every finding is tagged with one of four **trust axes** —
Security, Permission hygiene, Transparency, Quality — and the scanner
emits an A–F grade per axis on every scan.

It also parses the skill manifest YAML, so findings can be weighed against
what the skill *claims* it needs.

### Scope — which files are read

By default the scanner inspects only AI-agent configuration files: skill
manifests (`SKILL.md`, `skill.yaml`), per-harness instruction files
(`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` — Codex CLI/OpenCode, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursorrules`,
`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.windsurfrules`),
and MCP/settings configs (`.claude/settings.json`, `.mcp.json`,
`.claude/mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`) — plus arbitrary
files inside `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.opencode/`, `.cursor/`, `.gemini/`,
`.windsurf/` directories, plus **anything under a directory containing a
`SKILL.md`** — the whole skill subtree is in scope wherever that directory
sits, not just when it's installed under `.claude/skills/`. It honors
`.gitignore` and skips `node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`, `build`, `target`,
`.next`, `.git` (a `SKILL.md` inside one of those creates no scope root
either). Pass `--scan-all` to stop honoring `.gitignore` and walk every other
scannable file; the hardcoded skip-dirs above still apply, and a `SKILL.md`
inside one of them still creates no scope root.

The content rules above (injection, access control, exfiltration, etc.) run
uniformly across every harness's instruction files — the checks aren't
Claude-specific. Parsing each harness's own *structural* config format
(Codex `config.toml`, `opencode.json` permissions, Gemini CLI `settings.json`
specifics, Copilot org policies) is on the roadmap; today only Claude Code's
`.claude/settings.json` gets structural checks (SD-017..SD-020).

### What it does NOT check (by default)

- Source code files (`.ts`, `.py`, `.go`, etc.) — that's Snyk / Semgrep's lane.
- `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `dist/`, lock files — always skipped.
- Files matched by your repo's `.gitignore`.

To scan every file with a known extension instead, pass `--scan-all`.

## Install

```bash
# Homebrew (macOS / Linux)
brew install velzepooz/tap/skill-detector

# Go
go install github.com/velzepooz/skill-detector/cmd/skill-detector@latest
```

Or grab a prebuilt binary from
[Releases](https://github.com/skilltrust/skill-detector/releases)
(linux / darwin / windows × amd64 / arm64).

## Usage

```bash
# Scan a single skill folder (or a whole repo — only agent files inspected)
skill-detector scan ./path/to/some-skill
skill-detector scan ~/.claude/skills

# CI: fail on HIGH+ severity
skill-detector scan ./my-skill --fail-on high

# CI: fail on an axis-grade threshold
skill-detector scan ./my-skill --fail-on-axis security=B
# repeatable — combines with --fail-on (worst wins)
skill-detector scan . --fail-on-axis security=B --fail-on-axis permission_hygiene=C

# JSON output (for piping into other tools)
skill-detector scan ./my-skill --format json

# Just the 4-axis Trust Score on stdout (text format only; findings go to stderr)
skill-detector scan ./my-skill --axes-only

# Treat external MCP server URLs as High severity (default: Medium)
skill-detector scan ./my-skill --strict-mcp

# Quiet mode — exit code only
skill-detector scan ./my-skill --quiet

# Bypass scope tightening + .gitignore filtering (walks every scannable file)
skill-detector scan . --scan-all
```

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning                                                         |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | No findings                                                     |
| `1`  | Findings, all below your `--fail-on` / `--fail-on-axis` threshold |
| `2`  | Finding at or above threshold (worst of severity OR axis-grade) |
| `3`  | Tool error (bad arguments, unreadable path, internal failure)  |

Code `1` is a **warning state**, not a failure: findings exist, but none crossed
the threshold you set. Shells and CI runners don't know that — under `set -e`,
inside `&&` chains, or as a GitHub Actions step, *any* non-zero code fails the
build. Getting the warn-without-failing behavior takes one line:

```bash
# Minimal: succeed on 0 and 1, fail on 2 and 3
skill-detector scan . --fail-on high || [ $? -eq 1 ]
```

The minimal form still fails on `2` and `3`, but collapses both into `1` — use
the explicit form when the caller needs the original code:

```bash
# Explicit, and annotates the PR (GitHub Actions)
set -euo pipefail
skill-detector scan . --fail-on high && code=0 || code=$?
case $code in
  0) ;;
  1) echo "::warning::skill-detector: findings below threshold" ;;
  *) exit "$code" ;;   # 2 = threshold breach, 3 = tool error
esac
```

Don't collapse this to `|| true` — that swallows `3` as well, and a scan that
could not run is not a passing scan.

### Configuration

Drop a `.skill-detector.yml` (or `.skill-detectorrc` — checked first, for
backward compatibility) next to the skill (or pass `--config`) to toggle
rules and allowlist known-safe patterns. Defaults are sensible; most users
will only need config to suppress false positives.

### Trust Score (sample output)

```
Trust Score
  Security             D   High-severity issue: outbound network reference detected
  Permission hygiene   D   High-severity issue: broad shell permission granted: Bash(curl *)
  Transparency         A   no findings on this axis
  Quality              A   no findings on this axis
```

Per-axis grade is set by the **worst finding on that axis** (worst-finding-wins).
Each grade ships with a one-line human-readable rationale plus the rule IDs
that drove it — so disagreements become rule-tuning conversations, not
credibility hits.

## How it compares

Plenty of great security scanners already exist — why another one?

| Tool         | Why not just use it for skills?                                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **semgrep**  | Generic pattern engine — powerful, but *you* write the rules. `skill-detector` ships with skill-aware rules. |
| **gitleaks** | Narrower — only secrets. Doesn't cover prompt injection, permission mismatches, exfiltration.                |
| **trivy**    | CVEs in containers / OS packages — a different problem from skill semantics.                                 |
| **gosec**    | Scans Go source. Skills are YAML + Markdown + shell, not Go.                                                 |

Short version: use `skill-detector` when the thing you're scanning is an
AI skill package and you want rules that understand skill-manifest semantics
out of the box.

## Contributing

Issues are very welcome — bug reports, false positives, rule ideas, new skill
formats I haven't covered.

**For pull requests, please open an issue first** so we can agree on the
approach. This is a spare-time pet project; I'd rather not have anyone sink
effort into a PR that won't land.

Build / test / lint instructions: [`docs/development-guide.md`](./docs/development-guide.md).

## Reporting security issues

If you've found a vulnerability in `skill-detector` itself (not in a skill it
scanned), please file a
[private security advisory](https://github.com/skilltrust/skill-detector/security/advisories/new)
rather than a public issue.
