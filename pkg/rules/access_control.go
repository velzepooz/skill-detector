// it matches. Which test depends on the caller: credentialAccessRule uses
// invokesCommandOnCredentialLine (reShellInvocation plus the file readers),
// persistenceRule in integrity.go uses reShellInvocation alone. They are
// deliberately not the same predicate — see reCredentialFileReader. This
// regex must never be used as a standalone exemption, and the pairing must

// reShellInvocation matches imperative shell-command tokens (as standalone
// words followed by an argument) or shell metacharacters that indicate an
// executable command is present, even inside a documentary-shaped line.
// Vetoes reDocumentaryContext: a table row or interrogative bullet that
// contains a real command is not documentation, regardless of its shape.
//
// Deliberately does NOT veto on a bare backtick: Markdown code spans wrap
// paths in documentation near-universally (a code span reading ~/.ssh/),
// and a code span containing only a path is not an invocation. A
// backtick-wrapped command (a code span reading cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa) still
// vetoes because its content independently matches the imperative-token
// branch below — the backtick characters themselves carry no signal, only
// the text they wrap does.
//
// The single-`>` branch requires a redirect-shaped target (`~`, `./`, `/`,
// `$VAR`) and excludes a preceding `-`, so a Markdown arrow ("writes to
// .zshrc -> persistence") does not veto — `>>` (append) still vetoes
// unconditionally since it has no legitimate non-shell reading in prose.
//
// THIS REGEX IS SHARED. It vetoes reDocumentaryContext here in
// credentialAccessRule (SD-004) *and* in persistenceRule's shell-profile
// branch (SD-013, integrity.go). Widening it therefore changes an unrelated
// rule's output, in the direction of more findings. Do not add verbs here to
// fix an SD-004 problem — see reCredentialFileReader below, which exists
// precisely because that was tried and broke SD-013.

// reCredentialFileReader matches the read-and-inspect verbs that
// reShellInvocation's copy/move/fetch list omits. It is consulted ONLY by
// credentialAccessRule, through invokesCommandOnCredentialLine.
//
// Why it is a separate regex rather than more verbs in reShellInvocation:
// the final whole-branch review found that a documentary bullet reading a
// credential kept its exemption —
// `- app.credentials: use head -c 4096 ~/.credentials to read the token`
// graded permission_hygiene A — and the obvious fix was to widen
// reShellInvocation. That shipped, and the re-review caught what it did to
// SD-013: reShellInvocation is also the veto on persistenceRule's
// documentary damping, so ordinary threat-model questions started firing a
// CRITICAL persistence finding.
//
//   - Could it read .zshrc with grep to check settings?   -> SD-013 CRITICAL
//   - Could it open .bashrc to check settings?            -> SD-013 CRITICAL
//   - Does it use awk on .zshrc for parsing?              -> SD-013 CRITICAL
//
// All three are clean on either side of that mistake, and
// TestSD013_ReaderVerbsInInterrogativeBulletNotFlagged pins them. Keeping
// the two lists apart is what makes an SD-004 widening cost nothing
// anywhere else. reShellInvocation's own verb set must stay byte-identical
// to what SD-013 was measured against.
//
// `ssh` was on the review's list and is deliberately NOT here either. This
// regex is matched case-insensitively against prose, and `\bSSH\b\s+\S`
// matches the ordinary honest line `# Add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub to
// GitHub Settings -> SSH Keys` on the words "SSH Keys" — which, since
// allSSHPathsArePublic is vetoed through this path, would re-flag the exact
// benign shape that exemption exists for (TestSD004_SSHPublicKeyNotFlagged).

// `rsync` already cover the file-transfer half of it.

// skills and does not appear in hostile ones, which is what earns it an

//
// Anchored at BOTH ends (only leading/trailing whitespace tolerated), not
// just at line start: review round found the line-start-only anchor let
// anything appended after a real import clause ride along unexamined —
// `from a.credentials import y; import os; os.system('cat ~/.credentials')`

// in the line. The import-list character class deliberately excludes `.`,

// a second statement appended after the import breaks the match instead of

// ~/.ssh/ entry otherwise exists to catch — but checking the line as a whole
// for "a .pub reference somewhere" let a second, non-public path on the same

// what closes that. This must stay a universal test, never an existential

//
// "Every occurrence" can only mean every occurrence reSSHPathToken
// recognises. That regex was anchored to a literal `~/`, so a second read
// spelled `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa` or `${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa` was not a token and
// the line still read as all-public. Two independent closures apply, because
// the hole is reachable two ways:
//
//   - The caller vetoes this exemption with invokesCommandOnCredentialLine,
//     exactly as it already does for reCredentialsFieldDoc: a line that runs
//     a command is not a line documenting a public key, whatever paths it
//     names.
//   - reSSHPathToken itself now recognises the variable spellings, which
//     covers the lines that name a private key with no command on them —
//     an instruction to an agent is a program in an agent manifest.
//
// Keep both. Whether credentialPaths can DETECT a spelling on its own is a
// separate question from whether reSSHPathToken RECOGNISES it here: the token
// only has to be recognised for the line to stop reading as all-public.
//
// The shape this exemption was built for (`# Add
