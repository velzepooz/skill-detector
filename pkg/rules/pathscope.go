// A `../` reference is only traversal if it actually leaves the skill. Since
// v0.8.0 discovery stamps every file with the skill root it belongs to, so the
// rule can resolve the reference instead of pattern-matching it: a token that
// never takes the walk below its own skill root is an ordinary in-package
// reference, not an escape.
//
// Everything here is a pure function of the FileContext it is handed. It reads
// no files and resolves nothing against the real filesystem, which is what keeps
// pkg/rules embeddable and what keeps discovery's scoped os.Root the only thing
// that ever opens a path.
//
// The predicate is an ALLOW-list: a reference is released only when every one of
// its segments is an ordinary, well-formed path segment and the running depth
// never goes negative. Anything it cannot resolve confidently — a variable
// prefix, a percent-encoded separator, a run of three or more dots, an empty
// segment, or a match that is only part of a longer reference — is left flagged.
// Filter-bypass spellings such as `....//` and `..././` are therefore untouched
// by design.
//
// AMBIGUITY IS REFUSED, NOT RESOLVED. Every character the tokeniser cuts a line
// on is a legal POSIX filename character, so a cut is never proof that a
// reference ended there. Rather than guess, the predicate refuses to release any
// line whose reference region carries such a character at all: only a single,
// unbroken, unambiguous reference is ever released. The cost is that a line
// naming two references, or one reference beside a glob, stays flagged; the
// alternative is handing the climb budget out once per fragment, which releases
// references that genuinely leave the skill root.
//
// ANCHOR ASSUMPTION. The walk starts at the file's own depth below the skill
// root, which assumes the reference resolves relative to the directory the file
// sits in. For a script that holds only if the agent `cd`s to it (or uses
// `$(dirname "$0")`); a shell invoked from the project root resolves the same
// string somewhere else. The file-relative anchor is a deliberate choice, not
// an oversight: it is the only anchor a static scanner has, and ordinary
// in-package references are written against it too, so re-anchoring would mean
// guessing the agent's working directory and would re-flag the whole class this
// predicate exists to release. Changing the anchor needs the maintainer's
// sign-off.
//
// POSIX SLASHES ONLY. Both FileContext.Path and FileContext.SkillRoot are read
// as `/`-separated strings. Discovery stamps SkillRoot through filepath.ToSlash
// but not Path, so a path that does not arrive slash-separated yields no usable
// depth and every `../` in it stays flagged — SD-003 then behaves exactly as it
// did before this release. The failure direction is over-flagging, never
// under-flagging, which is why this is left as a documented property rather than
// guessed at with a separator heuristic here.

// reRelativePathToken matches a run containing `../`, cut at the characters that
// can end a shell word. It is deliberately its own pattern: widening
// rePathTraversal or any other shared regex to serve this predicate is how
// SD-004's widening once turned ordinary prose into Critical SD-013 findings.
//
// Its terminator class is deliberately not reFullPath's (access_control.go:18),
// which ends a path on `#`, `$`, `{`, `}` and runs straight through `*`, `(`,
// `<`. The two answer different questions — reFullPath extracts a path to quote
// in a finding, this one cuts a line into candidate references — so this file
// and access_control.go hold two different opinions about what ends a path token
// on purpose. EVERY character cut on here is legal inside a POSIX filename —
// a space, a tab, `(`, `;`, `&`, `<`, `*` and the rest — so a cut is never
// proof that a reference ended. That is why the release decision does not trust
// the cut: referenceRegionIsUnambiguous refuses the whole line the moment one of
// these characters falls inside the region the references occupy, and
// isWholeReference refuses a match that abuts one on the outside.
var reRelativePathToken = regexp.MustCompile("[^\\s\"'`()\\[\\]<>,;|&*]*\\.\\./[^\\s\"'`()\\[\\]<>,;|&*]*")

// reOrdinarySegment is the allow-list charset for a single path segment.
// `+` is inert for path resolution (no shell or filesystem meaning here); it's
// allow-listed only because it's a legal filename character.
var reOrdinarySegment = regexp.MustCompile(`^[A-Za-z0-9._@+~-]+$`)

// unresolvableTokenChars are the characters that make a token's target
// impossible to know statically. Tested against the whole token, not per
// segment: a token carrying any of them anywhere is never released.
//
// This check is deliberately REDUNDANT today and no test can prove otherwise:
// every character in the set also falls outside reOrdinarySegment, so the
// segment walk below refuses the same tokens on its own — removing this `if`
// breaks nothing in the suite (verified by construction, not assumed). It is
// kept as a cheap early exit and as depth: it becomes load-bearing the moment
// reOrdinarySegment is widened, which is a live possibility — the ASCII-only
// charset is what the residual false positives this predicate accepts are the
// price of. Widening that charset without keeping this guard would release
// `$HOME/../..`.

// referenceBoundaryChars are the characters that may stand immediately OUTSIDE
// a complete reference without being part of it: shell word separators, quoting
// and grouping. Every one of them is also legal inside a filename, so this set
// alone can never establish that a match is whole — that job belongs to
// referenceRegionIsUnambiguous, which runs first and refuses the line whenever
// any of these appears *between* the references. What is left for this set is
// the outside edge: a match abutting a character that is NOT here — `*`, `[`,

// fragments and each fragment is then walked from the file's own depth, handing
// out the climb budget twice. `../a(b)c/../../outside/x` from one level below
// the root is the shape: two fragments, both apparently in-package, one real
// reference that leaves the skill.
//
// So the predicate does not try to decide which side of the cut is real. It
// refuses to release a line whose reference region contains any of these at all
// (see referenceRegionIsUnambiguous). Only an unambiguous, single, unbroken
// reference is ever released, which is the direction this predicate must fail
// in: every ambiguous spelling stays flagged.

// be read two ways: as several separate references, or as one longer reference
