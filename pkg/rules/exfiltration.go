// request with no command substitution anywhere, which is why they are tested
// independently of reCmdSubst — the repo's own canonical SD-007 fixture uses
// this form.
//
// Two things the pattern has to get right:
//
//   - The `@` must open the argument, or a `field=` value. Allowing it
//     anywhere made an email address in a literal body —
//     `-d '{"email":"user@example.com"}'` — read as a file upload.
//   - A short option's value may be attached: curl parses `-d@FILE` exactly
//     as `-d @FILE` (verified against curl 8.7.1 — both fail with "error
//     encountered when reading a file", where a literal body reaches the
//     connection attempt). Requiring a separator made the check a
//     one-character evasion.
//
// pathArg is what an upload flag's value looks like when it names a file:
// an absolute or home-rooted path, a `./` relative one, or any of those
// written through a variable. The trailing slash after the variable is what
// makes `$HOME/.aws/credentials` a path and `$TIMEOUT` a number — without it,

// wget's `-T` is `--timeout` and `wget -T 30` must not read as an upload.
// Every one of those versions was wrong about shell syntax in a new way: a
// newline inside a joined statement, an `&` inside a quoted query string, the
// word "curl" in a trailing comment.
//
// None of that is what the demotion needs to know. This flag's argument is
// either a file or a number of seconds: a path is `~/…`, `/…` or `./…`, and a
// timeout is digits — including when the path is written through a variable,
// where the slash after it is what separates `$HOME/.aws/…` from `$TIMEOUT`.
// Testing the argument separates them without knowing where any command
// begins, which is why this rule no longer parses shell at all.
